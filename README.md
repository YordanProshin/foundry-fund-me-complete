# Foundry Fund Me (Complete)

Welcome to my first Solidity smart contract project using **Foundry**!  
This project is part of my learning journey into blockchain development and will be featured in my portfolio as I pursue a career as a **Solidity Smart Contract Developer**.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

This project demonstrates how to build and test a basic **crowdfunding (fund me)** smart contract with:

- `receive()` and `fallback()` functions
- Gas optimization techniques
- Integration with Chainlink price feeds (ETH/USD)
- Deployer/funder tracking
- Solidity best practices
- Unit testing and deployment using Foundry

## ðŸ§± Built With

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) â€“ for smart contract development and testing
- Solidity â€“ core smart contract language
- Chainlink â€“ for decentralized price feeds
- Git & GitHub â€“ for version control and hosting
